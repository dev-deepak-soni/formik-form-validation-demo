  <meta name="description" content="Formic is a popular library for building forms in React. With its powerful validation capabilities, it allows developers to easily validate form input and provide feedback to users in real-time. The Formic validation application is a web application that has been created specifically for the purpose of validating user input in forms.

  The application provides an easy-to-use interface for users to create forms and add validation rules to form inputs. Users can select from a variety of validation rules such as required fields, email validation, number validation, and more. The application also provides custom validation rules, which allow users to define their own validation logic.
  
  Once the user has created a form and added validation rules, the application generates the necessary code to integrate the form into their React application. The generated code includes all the necessary hooks and components to integrate the form with the Formic library.
  
  During form submission, the Formic validation application performs real-time validation of the user input and provides feedback to the user if any errors are detected. The user can then correct their input and resubmit the form. Once the form is successfully submitted, the application provides a success message to the user.
  
  Overall, the Formic validation application is a powerful tool for developers who want to create forms with robust validation capabilities. With its easy-to-use interface and powerful validation features, it makes it easy for developers to create forms that are both user-friendly and secure." />

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
